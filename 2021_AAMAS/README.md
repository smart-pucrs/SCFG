# Feasible Coalition Sequences

In this work we investigate the interdependence of Characteristic-Function Games (CFG).
We propose a heuristic-based algorithm for solving this problem, named Multiple Coalition Linkage (MC-Link); it is inspired by [C-Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197616302536). 

We compare it against a brute-force algorithm for a specific binary relation. That relation contains pairs of Coalition Structures (CS) in which the second element contains only coalitions that are a subset of a coalition in the first element. In addition, the first element of the pair contains less coalitions than the second element.

For more details, we refer to our publication in [AAMAS 2021 (forthcoming)]().

## Setup

To setup your environment create a virtual environment (instructions [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)), and inside your new environment run the following:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running
You can run a single algorithm by choosing a file with the prefix *alg_*. To run one of the experiments, choose a file in which its name starts with the prefix *exp_*. The code to generate the charts are placed in folder *results*.   

## Be Careful

After choosing an experiment to run, note that the experiment may require the values for any given coalition to be queried in a table or generated by a function. That means you need to adjust the MC-Link's code to comply with the chosen experiment.

Experiment          | CF Mode
------------------- | -------------
exp_bf-mclink_time  | function
exp_bf-mclink_value | table
exp_mclink_time     | function

</center>

When an experiment requires:
- **table** mode: in MC-Link's code, you should use lines 37 and 85. In Brute force, line 26.
- **function** mode: in MC-Link's code, you should use lines 38 and 86. In Brute force, line 27.
