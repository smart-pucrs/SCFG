# Sequential Characteristic-Function Games

In this repository, we maintain the main work related to the Sequential Characteristic-Function Games (SCFG). In this setting, we investigate the interdependence of Characteristic-Function Games (CFG), which are received as input in a total ordered sequence. The solution for such a game is an ordered sequence, according to the input, of coalition structures.

- **2021** [Computing Sequences of Coalition Structures](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9660127): we investigate constraints applied to individual games in a SCFG. We propose the integration of SCFG and [Valuation Structures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370217300516) (VS), resulting in a framework called **Sequential CFGs induced by VSs** (SEQVS). In addition, we propose an **exact** algorithm based on dynamic programming that solves both SEQVS and SCFG instances (given the proper modifications). This algorithm is named SDP. For the experiments, we adapt [MC-Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3463952.3464039) to cope with VSs. All the experiments are available in folder [*2021_SSCI*](https://github.com/smart-pucrs/SCFG/tree/main/2021_SSCI).

We theoretically investigate how this setting relates to other coalition formation problems. Further, we propose a heuristic based algorithm (inspired by [C-Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197616302536)) and experiment with it (watch our presentation [here](https://slideslive.com/38954936/feasible-coalition-sequences)).
